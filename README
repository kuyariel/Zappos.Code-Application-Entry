Application for Zappos.Code()

Greetings. This is a readme for the files contained within this repository.
Each of these files are meant as a response to the application questions found
at zcode.zappos.com. More specific information about the programs can be found
in their respective source codes. Each were written in C++ and would just need
to be pushed through a compiler in order to work.

Question 2: Ninja Books
This program's source code is found in Ninjabooks.cpp. When run, it asks
the user for a number of books and the name of each book. It then outputs
the data in alphabetical order sideways as if they were sitting on a bookshelf.

Question 3: Dragon Zoo
My response to this question can be found in Dragons.doc

Question 4: Zappos.Code()
My response to this question can be found in PersonalDescription.txt

Question BONUS!
This program's source code is found in Sudoku.cpp. In its present state, it
has issues creating more difficult puzzles. When run, it should output a random
and valid sudoku puzzle. Input any character to display the solution.

Question BONUS (THE SEQUEL)!
This program's source code is found in To-Do.cpp. When run, it asks the user to
enter N to create a new file, or enter O to open an existing one. When creating a new
file, the number of to-do list items is inputted, followed by each individual item.
This to-do list is then saved in the same directory as the program with the appropriate
filename. This file can be opened with this program by entering O at the prompt. When
an existing file is opened, it is displayed to the screen and the user is given the
options to add, delete, edit, or sort the items.
