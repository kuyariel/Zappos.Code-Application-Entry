I'm excited about Zappos.Code mainly for the chance to learn more in a
coding environment. As an electrical engineering major, I had to take a
introductory C++ class. I had never learned any sort of programming before,
so I was a bit worried about how I'd do. After a few classes, I became
extremely interested in the subject. I would look forward to each new coding
project and immediately get started with it as soon as I got home. I would 
finish projects weeks in advance, and I'd always be looking for more. More
opportunities, or more challenges. After taking that class, I decided that I
needed to take more classes in programming. Perhaps by taking a minor in CS.
I admit I do not have much experience. I couldn't create the zombie website
because I only have very basic html skills. Even then, I'd still have to 
look up a lot of stuff in the process. I know nothing more than one semester 
of C++, and it is with that knowledge that I coded every other application question.

What I lack in experience, I make up for with a desire to learn. If you are
looking for someone deeply interested and passionate about learning more about 
this subject, then I am the perfect candidate. If I am not accepted based on my 
lack of skills, then hopefully you will consider me again next year after I 
gain more experience in computer science.

I thoroughly enjoyed writing code for your questions. They posed quite a challenge. 
If selected, I am sure I'll enjoy the opportunity to learn with you guys even more so.

Thank you all for reviewing my application, and thank you for considering me for your 
internship program.
